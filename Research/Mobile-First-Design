# Mobile First Design

** Mobile-first design ** is a design philosophy that aims to create better experiences for users by starting the design process from the smallest of screens: mobile. 
### What is Mobile First Design?

1. Responsive Web Design 
    Responsive web design is a web design method that enables web to fit the screens of different devices automatically, displaying
    the content in a way that people feel comfortable. This greatly reduces users’ operations like panning, zooming and scrolling when browsing the web.
2. Progressive Advancement” & “Graceful Degradation
    These two concepts were put forward before responsive web design. In order to make web or application interface display reasonably on different devices.
    #### Progressive Advancement
        means that when we design a product, first we build a version for the relatively lower browser (like that on a mobile phone). This version includes
        the most basic functions & features. After that, we tend to the advanced version for a tablet or PC, which is created by adding interactions, more
        complicated effects, etc. on the basic version for a better user experience.
    #### Graceful Degradation
        starts the product design from an advanced end like desktop and builds a version with well-rounded features at the beginning. Then designers make
        the product compatible with mobile ends by cutting some functions or contents.
3. Mobile first is content first
    Content takes center stage in mobile first design.
